headline: Instance segmentation for object detection and masking.
domain: Computer Vision
description: Mask R-CNN is a machine learning model that extends Faster R-CNN to perform instance segmentation by detecting objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. It adds a branch for predicting segmentation masks in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition.
